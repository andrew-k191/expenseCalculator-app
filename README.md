## Summary

Of the prior projects I completed, I had the most fun working on this project. Part of the reason is that I already had a personal expense calculator that I used in Microsoft Word. I think it helped give me an idea of how I wanted to setup and implement the logic of this app. Nevertheless there were still issues I encountered along the way. In particular, I had problems figuring out how to calculate and continously update the total cost. I also encountered problems configuring the output of the date. 

I'm excited to get started on the next project!
